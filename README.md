# OperatorOverloading
School assignment. Overload operators ! and ~ to find absolute value and conjugate respectively.
INSTRUCTIONS: 

Let a + ib be a complex number. The conjugate of a + ib is a – ib, and the absolute value of a + ib is  √(a^(2 )+ b^2 ). 

Extend the definition of the class completType given below by overloading the operators ~ and ! as member functions 
so that ~ returns the conjugate of the complex number and ! returns the absolute value. 
Also write the definition of these operator functions.
